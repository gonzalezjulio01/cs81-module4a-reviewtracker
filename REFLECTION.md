# Reflection – Reading Tracker

## What was the most helpful aspect of this code’s structure?

The code was clean and easy to follow. The data was stored in an array of objects, which made it simple to loop through and access each entry. Each function had a clear purpose and used names that helped me understand what it was doing. The layout made it easy to test, read, and debug.

## What part was confusing or took longer to understand?

It took a little while to understand how the `mostReadBook` function worked. The way it used an object to count book appearances was new to me. But after reading the loop and seeing how it updates the count, it started to make sense. Looking at the test output helped confirm what it was doing.
