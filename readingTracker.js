//  Suggested Improvement:
// The functions always use the global `readingLog` directly.
// A better design would be to pass `readingLog` into every function,
// so the functions are reusable with other logs if needed.


//  Example usage (test cases):

// Adds a new book entry for Saturday
addReadBook("Saturday", "Dune", 50);

// Adds a new test case for Sunday
addReadBook("Sunday", "The Alchemist", 35);  // ðŸ‘ˆ This is the new test case you added

// Prints a summary of each dayâ€™s reading
printDailySummary(readingLog);

// Logs the total minutes read in the week
console.log("Total minutes read:", totalReadingMinutes(readingLog));

// Logs the most read book
console.log("Most read book:", mostReadBook(readingLog));
